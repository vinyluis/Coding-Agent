# Examples for LangGraph Coding Agent

This folder contains examples of how to use the LangGraph Coding Agent for solving different programming problems.

## Example 1: Factorial Calculator

**File**: `example1.py`

This example demonstrates the coding agent creating a class that calculates factorials. The agent will:

1. Generate a `Factorial` class in Python that can calculate the factorial of a positive integer
2. Create comprehensive tests for the class
3. Execute the tests to validate the solution
4. Fix any errors found during testing

To run this example:
```
python example1.py
```

## Example 2: CSV Data Processor

**File**: `example2.py`

This example demonstrates the coding agent processing CSV data. The agent will:

1. Read an input CSV containing sales data
2. Process and transform the data to extract useful metrics
3. Output the results to a new CSV file
4. Create comprehensive tests to validate the solution

To run this example:
```
python example2.py
```

## Notes

- These examples assume that you already have all the required dependencies installed
- The coding agent requires an OpenAI API key set in your environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY)
- The examples use the same agent.py file in the parent directory
